## Brief 

In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

## Recipe Page Content
The recipe page should have the following content:

- An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or the recipe site we linked to earlier.
- Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
- Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
- Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.
