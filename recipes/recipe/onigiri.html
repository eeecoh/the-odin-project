        <p>Onigiri, also known as omusubi, nigirimeshi, or rice ball, is a Japanese food made from white rice formed into triangular or cylindrical shapes and often wrapped in nori. </p>
        <p><strong>Place of origin: </strong> Japan</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice (However much you want to make).</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Optional:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nori - The thin, paper like seaweed used to wrap up sushi</li>
            <li>Furikake - Also known as rice seasoning</li>
            <li>Peas</li>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Fillings - The most common filling for onigiri would probably be umeboshi,
                 or sour pickled plums, however it is quite and acquired taste. Other common 
                 fillings are canned tuna (mixed with mayo and sometimes wasabi), cooked tuna 
                 or other fish, fried chicken, a little cooked spam, or just about any kind 
                 of pickled vegetable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Once the rice is cooked and cooled down, all you have to do is shape them.
                 Use some plastic wrap if you have a hard time shaping them. 
                 Put a scoop of rice in the middle of the plastic wrap and wrap it up. <br><br>
            <strong>Onigiri Variation #1: Pea Onigiri</strong> If you want to make pea onigiri, 
            or you want to mix in some furikake, you need to do this before you put the rice in the plastic wrap. 
             Just take your scoop of rice, put it in a bowl, and mix in your ingredients with a utensil. <br><br></li>
             <li>Now, the shaping.  Hold the wrapped up rice in your hand.  
                Cup your hand so it looks like a “U”, and then cup your other hand, perpendicularly, 
                on top of it tightly.  Gently squeeze the rice. 
                 If you’re doing it correctly, it should start to look kind of like a triangle. 
                  Then, rotate the rice ball in your hands, so a different point is pointing downward and repeat. <br><br>
                <strong>Onigiri Variation #2: Filling</strong> If you want to add a filling, sometime near the end of forming the onigiri, 
                press a dent in the middle of rice with your thumb.  Add your filling, and cover the hole with more rice, and continue forming. <br><br></li>
            <li>Take the rice out of the plastic wrap and form it a few times with your bare hands.  Then place it on a plate, and sprinkle some salt on them. <br><br>
            <strong>Onigiri Variation #3: Nori</strong> You can add nori to just about any type of onigiri.  You’ll need to cut up the nori to fit, 
            but you can cut it into any shape you want, be it a larger sheet to cover the entire onigiri, a small little rectangle for just on the bottom, or some cute shapes. <br><br>
        <strong>Onigiri Variation #4: Sprinkle</strong> In addition to the salt, you can sprinkle some sesame seeds or furikake on top, and press it into the rice. </li>
        </ol>
